## 🧠 Introduction

This project demonstrates how I deployed a **full-stack web application** built with **React (frontend)** and **FastAPI (backend)** on **Microsoft Azure**, using **Docker**, **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**, and **Docker Compose**.

It’s a complete DevOps workflow — from containerization and image management to cloud-based deployment on an Azure Virtual Machine.
