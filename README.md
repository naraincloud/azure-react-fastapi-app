# 🚀  Deploying a Full Stack React + FastAPI Application using Docker, Azure Container Registry (ACR), and Azure Virtual Machine (VM)



## 🧠 Introduction

This project demonstrates how I deployed a **full-stack web application** built with **React (frontend)** and **FastAPI (backend)** on **Microsoft Azure**, using **Docker**, **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**, and **Docker Compose**.

It’s a complete DevOps workflow from containerization and image management to cloud based deployment on an Azure Virtual Machine.
